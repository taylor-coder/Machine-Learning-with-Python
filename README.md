Medical insurance costs prediction - machine learning via Python

After reading an interesting article showing how someone predicted medical insurance costs via linear regression, I decided to go through the code, try to break the code, and see how the code works under various circumstances. 

At a glance, it appears that two of the most common factors for increased health insurance costs are someone's smoking status and age, which this model is trained to test and account for. Overall, I really liked the code and it provides a very nice and practical introduction to machine learning for those interested. I've provided the link below for more details.  

My results - compared to the results shown in the article link provided below - show that insurance companies are likely to attach a strong paying premium to smokers and older persons. This revelation coincides with what the general consensus (research and policies pertaining to smoking and surcharges) provides.
