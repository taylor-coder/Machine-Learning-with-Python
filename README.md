Medical insurance costs prediction - machine learning via Python

After reading an interesting article showing how someone predicted medical insurance costs via linear regression, I decided to go through the code, try to break the code, and see how the code works under various circumstances. 

From my analysis, it appears that one of the most common factors for increased health insurance risk factors may be someone's smoking status. 

My results compared to the results shown in the article below show that insurance companies are likely to attach a strong paying premium to smokers, which goes along with what the general consensus on research and policies pertaining to smoking and surcharges note.
